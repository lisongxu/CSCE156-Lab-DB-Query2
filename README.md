## Lab 9.0 - Advanced MySQL 

An introduction to MySQL used in databases.

This is a lab used in Computer Science II (CSCE 156) for Fall 2023 
in the [School of Computing](https://computing.unl.edu) 
at the [University of Nebraska-Lincoln](https://www.unl.edu).

## Overview

### Lab Objectives & Topics

Following the lab, you should be able to:

-   perform advanced database query operations on multiple tables
  
-   understand complex queries using aggregate functions and group by clauses

Note that the lab may involve some concepts or statements not covered (yet) in the class. You should be able to complete the lab without fully understanding them. If you have any questions about them, please feel free to ask our LAs. 


### Peer Programming Pair-Up

At the start of
each lab, you may find a team member by yourself or may be randomly paired up with another student by
a lab instructor.  One of you will be designated the *driver* 
and the other the *navigator*. If you prefer to work on this lab by yourself, that is fine too.  Each week you should try to alternate: if you were a driver 
last week, be a navigator next, etc. 

***Note that, each student must answer the lab questions on Canvas for grading.***

  
## 1. Connect to MySQL server on Linux server

Please connect to the same MySQL server running on `cse-linux-01.unl.edu` of School of Computing.

## 2. Activities 

1. Download the provided MySQL file [`albumsDB2.sql`](albumsDB2.sql), which creates multiple tables about music albums, songs, and the artists involved.

***Note that this file is *different*  from the one in the previous lab.***

Below is the entity-relation diagram of these tables.

2. Replace `lxu3` in the first line of the code with your MySQL username. 

3. Execute the modified MySQL code, which takes some time to create all the tables and insert all the data.

4. Please write join select statements to find the information asked in the lab questions on Canvas.

## 3. Answer the lab questions on Canvas

* You do not need to submit any MySQL code or any MySQL statements for this lab. Instead please answer the lab questions on Canvas.
